  abstract  = {We consider the Calculus of Constructions with typed beta-eta equality and an algorithm which computes long normal forms. The normalization algorithm evaluates terms into a semantic domain, and reifies the values back to terms in normal form. To show termination, we interpret types as partial equivalence relations between values and type constructors as operators on PERs. This models also yields consistency of the beta-eta-Calculus of Constructions. The model construction can be carried out directly in impredicative type theory, enabling a formalization in Coq.},
